# Maze-Generator-and-Solver
Python maze generator and solver, using multiple algorithms (Recursive Backtracking, Aldous-Broder, Sidewinder, Binary Tree, Dijkstra’s). Includes step-by-step for visualization for the Recursive Backtracking solver. Works best with square mazes and may have limitations or unexpected behavior for grids smaller than 5×5.
